# Browser overlay

The overlay runs inside your *Angular page. It reads Angular's debug API and sends live data to the devtools server. Importing the module starts it, so in most apps one dynamic import in `main.ts` is all you need.

## Load it in development

### Pick your build tool

Load the overlay after bootstrap, with a dynamic import that only runs in development:

```ts group="overlay" name="Angular CLI" image="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/angular/DD0031" active
// src/main.ts
import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {App} from './app/app';
import {appConfig} from './app/app.config';

bootstrapApplication(App, appConfig)
  .then(() => {
    if (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) {
      return import('@pangular-inspector/core/overlay');
    }
    return undefined;
  })
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

```ts group="overlay" name="Analog (Vite)" image="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/vite/646CFF"
// src/main.ts
import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {App} from './app/app';
import {appConfig} from './app/app.config';

bootstrapApplication(App, appConfig).then(() => {
  if (import.meta.env.DEV) void import('@pangular-inspector/core/overlay');
});
```

### Why development only

The overlay reads `window.ng`, Angular's debug API. Production builds remove it, so the overlay has nothing to read there. The dynamic import keeps the overlay out of your production bundle.

## How it connects

### Where it looks

The overlay looks for the devframe connection next to the page first. Then it tries these paths in order:

1. `/__ng-devtools/`
2. `/__devframes/ng-devtools/`

It also adds the [floating button](./popup-and-hub.md). With the hub mounted, the button opens the whole hub, with every dock in a side rail.

### Snapshots and events

On Angular 20 and later, the overlay reads the page about 250 ms after Angular runs change detection. It also reads it every 4 seconds as a heartbeat. Until the app bootstraps, it reads the page every 3 seconds instead. Change that interval with [`limits.refreshMs`](./configuration.md#limits).

Each read skips data that did not change. Router events are sent as they happen.

### One id per tab

Each browser tab gets its own page id, kept in `sessionStorage`. The devtools use it to tell tabs apart. When a tab closes, its data is dropped.

## A custom mount path

### Call `initOverlay`

If you mount the devtools somewhere else, call `initOverlay` with that path:

```ts
// src/main.ts
import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {App} from './app/app';
import {appConfig} from './app/app.config';

bootstrapApplication(App, appConfig).then(async () => {
  if (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) {
    const {initOverlay} = await import('@pangular-inspector/core/overlay');
    const dispose = await initOverlay({baseURL: '/__my-devtools/'});
  }
});
```

`baseURL` takes one path or a list of paths to try in order. `initOverlay` resolves to a function that stops the overlay it started and removes its hooks.

The floating button follows the path the overlay connected to. If that path is `<base>ng-devtools/` and a hub answers at `<base>`, the button opens the hub. Otherwise it opens the devtools panel at that path.

### One overlay per page

Only one overlay runs on a page. Importing the module already starts one on the default URLs. When you call `initOverlay`, it stops the running overlay first, the auto-started one included, and then starts yours. The page never ends up with two connections.

An overlay that was stopped or replaced before it connected does not report its connection error.

## Stop the overlay

Call `disposeOverlay` to turn the overlay off:

```ts
// src/app/devtools-toggle.ts
import {disposeOverlay} from '@pangular-inspector/core/overlay';

export async function stopDevtools() {
  await disposeOverlay();
}
```

`disposeOverlay` stops whichever overlay is running, including the one that importing the module started. It closes the connection, clears its timers, listeners and observers, and removes the floating button.

To send data again, call `initOverlay`. It does not add the floating button back.

## NgRx signal stores

The overlay also exports `registerNgrxSignals`. Call it once with `patchState` and `watchState`. Restoring a store's state then notifies `watchState` listeners, and the change log gets one entry per `patchState` call:

```ts {8-13}
// src/main.ts
import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {App} from './app/app';
import {appConfig} from './app/app.config';

bootstrapApplication(App, appConfig).then(() => {
  if (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) {
    return Promise.all([import('@pangular-inspector/core/overlay'), import('@ngrx/signals')]).then(
      ([devtools, {patchState, watchState}]) =>
        devtools.registerNgrxSignals({patchState, watchState}),
    );
  }
  return undefined;
});
```

See [Restore NgRx signal state](../guides/ngrx-signals-restore.md).

## No devtools server found

If no path answers, the overlay logs an error that starts with `[ng-devtools] No devtools server found` and lists the paths it tried. The floating button still appears, and its panel says **No devtools server found** with a link to the setup guide.

Common causes:

- No server part is mounted, for example plain `ng serve` without `initNgDevtoolsHub()` in `server.ts`.
- The hub is mounted after `express.static` or the SSR handler, so the app answers first.
- The hub runs on a custom `base`, and the overlay still uses the default paths. Pass the path to [`initOverlay`](#a-custom-mount-path).

The overlay and the button do not start inside the devtools panel frame, so a misconfigured panel never shows a second button.

## Highlighting

When you hover or focus a row in the devtools, the overlay draws an amber box around its element in the page. The box follows the element and stays until the pointer or focus leaves the row. The box also clears when the panel closes, reloads or loses its connection to the dev server. If that clear never reaches the page, the box clears after 60 seconds. A box drawn by the [`highlight` agent tool](../agents/tools.md) clears after 2 seconds.

While you pick an element on the page, the box follows the pointer and clears when the pointer leaves the page or picking ends.

- The box also works for SVG hosts, like `g[app-bar]` in a chart.
- A host with `display: contents` has no box of its own, so the box goes around its children.
- A hidden host (`display: none`, an inactive tab panel) gets no box.
- The box is shown in the browser top layer, so it stays visible over an open `<dialog>`, a popover or a CDK overlay.
- The `highlight` agent tool and a click on a component chip in the Pipes tab also scroll the element into view.

## FAQ

<ngmd-accordion>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Do I need to call createDevtoolsPopup too?" open>
    No. The overlay adds the floating button itself. See <a href="./popup-and-hub.md">Popup and hub</a>.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Does it slow down my app?">
    It reads the page after change detection, at most once every 250 ms, plus a heartbeat every 4 seconds. It sends an inspector's data only when it changed. The HTTP inspector sends only the calls made since its last report. When the data of the components, signals, injectors, router or HTTP inspector stays the same for 5 to 8 seconds, the page sends a short ping instead, so the server keeps the page. With the dynamic import above, it never loads in production builds.

  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Which values leave the page?">
    Live values are sent to the devtools server. Secret-looking values are redacted first. See <a href="../security.md">Access and redaction</a>.
