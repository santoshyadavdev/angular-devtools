description: Run the devtools from the command line, build a static report, or start an MCP server.

<ngmd-hero title="Standalone CLI" gradient>
  Three commands from one binary. A local devtools server, an offline report, and an MCP server for coding agents.
</ngmd-hero>

# Standalone CLI

The package installs a `pangular` binary. Run it from the root of your Angular workspace, or point it there with `--root`. It scans the source files in that folder, so it works without starting your app.

## Commands

| Command | What it does                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`   | Starts a local server with the devtools UI.         |
| `build` | Writes a static copy of the devtools with the scan. |
| `mcp`   | Starts an MCP server over stdio for coding agents.  |

`pangular --version` prints the package version. An unknown command or flag prints one error line and exits with code 1. `pangular --help` lists the commands and flags.

### Flags for every command

| Flag              | What it does                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--root <dir>`    | The project folder to scan. The default is `NG_DEVTOOLS_ROOT`, then the working directory.                                                                            |
| `--config <file>` | A JSON file with the [devtools options](./configuration.md). The default is `NG_DEVTOOLS_CONFIG`, then `ng-devtools.config.json` in the project folder, if it exists. |
| `--read-only`     | Sets `agent.readOnly`: drops the agent tools that act on the page or the server. See [Inspectors and agent tools](./configuration.md#inspectors-and-agent-tools).     |

If the project folder has no `angular.json` and no `package.json` that depends on `@angular/core`, the CLI prints a warning on stderr, because the scans find nothing there.

### Config file

The file holds the same options as `createNgDevtools()`, as JSON:

```json
// ng-devtools.config.json
{
  "inspectors": {"analog": false},
  "agent": {"readOnly": true},
  "redaction": {"secretNames": ["passport"]}
}
```

A missing `--config` file or invalid JSON stops the command with an error.

### Run it without installing

```bash group="run" name="npx" image="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/npm/CB3837" active
npx @pangular-inspector/core dev
```

```bash group="run" name="pnpm" image="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/pnpm/F69220"
pnpm dlx @pangular-inspector/core dev
```

```bash group="run" name="yarn" image="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/yarn/2C8EBB"
yarn dlx @pangular-inspector/core dev
```

```bash group="run" name="bun" image="https://bun.sh/logo.svg"
bunx @pangular-inspector/core dev
```

### Run the installed binary

With the package installed in your project, call the binary through your package manager:

```bash
npx pangular dev
npx pangular build --outDir dist-report
npx pangular mcp
```

## Dev server

### Start it

The default command starts a local server with the devtools UI. `dev` is optional: `npx @pangular-inspector/core` does the same.

```bash
npx @pangular-inspector/core dev --port 9999 --open
```

When the server is ready, it prints the version, the panel URL, the panel URL for [Angular Native](./angular-native.md) apps and the MCP endpoint:

```text
  pangular v0.0.6
  Panel: http://localhost:9999/
  Angular Native apps: http://localhost:9999/?view=angular-native
  MCP:   http://localhost:9999/__mcp
```

If you pass no `--port` and port 9999 is taken, it also prints the port it uses instead.

### Dev server flags

| Flag                  | What it does                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--port <port>`       | Port to listen on. The default is 9999. If it is taken, a random free port is used. |
| `--host <host>`       | Host to bind to. The default is `localhost`.                                        |
| `--open`, `--no-open` | Open the browser on start, or not.                                                  |
| `--no-auth`           | Turn off the one-time code the server asks for.                                     |
| `--mcp`, `--no-mcp`   | Mount the MCP endpoint at `/__mcp`, or not. It is on by default.                    |

<ngmd-callout type="warning" title="Keep it on localhost">
  The server binds to <code>localhost</code> by default and asks for a one-time code. Changing <code>--host</code> or passing <code>--no-auth</code> widens who can reach it. See <a href="../security.md">Access and redaction</a>.
</ngmd-callout>

### What it shows

When no app is connected, the tabs show what your source declares. An [Angular Native](./angular-native.md) app connects through the **Angular Native apps** URL above and shows live data there:

- [Components](../inspectors/components.md)
- [Routes](../inspectors/router.md)
- [Signals](../inspectors/signals.md)
- [Providers](../inspectors/injectors.md)
- [NgRx declarations](../inspectors/ngrx-store.md)
- [Pipes](../inspectors/pipes.md)

<ngmd-alert severity="helpful">
  For live data, mount the devtools in your app's own server. See <a href="./express.md">Angular CLI and Express</a> or <a href="./vite.md">Vite and Analog</a>.
</ngmd-alert>

## Static report

### Build it

`build` writes a self-contained static copy of the devtools with the source scan baked in: components, routes, signals, providers, pipes, NgRx declarations and build metadata.

```bash
npx @pangular-inspector/core build --outDir dist-report
```

### Report flags

| Flag             | What it does                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--outDir <dir>` | Output directory. The default is `dist-static`. It is emptied first.      |
| `--pretty`       | Pretty-print the data files. They get larger on disk.                     |
| `--force`        | Empty `--outDir` even when it holds files that are not a previous report. |

### Output folder checks

The build deletes everything in `--outDir` before it writes the report. To protect your files, it stops with an error when `--outDir` is:

- the working directory or one of its parents, even with `--force`. With `--root`, this covers both the folder you ran the command from and the `--root` folder,
- a file, or a folder that is not empty and has no `__connection.json` (so it is not a previous report), unless you pass `--force`.

### Open or host it

The output is static files. Open it offline or host it on any static file server. It is a snapshot of your source at build time, so rebuild it after code changes.

## MCP server

### Start it over stdio

`mcp` starts an *MCP server over stdio for coding agents:

```bash
npx @pangular-inspector/core mcp
```

Your agent client runs this command for you. [MCP server](../agents/mcp-server.md) covers client setup.

### Source scan only

The stdio server has no page connected, so it registers only the tools that read your source files. The tools that need a page, such as `highlight`, `navigate`, `form-action` and the forms and router tools, are left out. For live data, point your agent at the HTTP endpoint of a running app instead. On a hub it lives at `/__devframes/__mcp`.

## FAQ

<ngmd-accordion>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Do I need to run my app first?" open>
    No. All three commands read your source files. Only live data needs a running app with the overlay loaded.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Which directory should I run it from?">
    The root of your Angular workspace. The scan starts from the current directory, or from the folder you pass with <code>--root</code>.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Port 9999 is taken">
    Without <code>--port</code>, the server picks a random free port and prints it. Pass <code>--port</code> to choose one yourself.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
