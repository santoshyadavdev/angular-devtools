# Pangular Inspector docs writing guide

The human-readable version of this guide is `apps/docs/src/content/contributing/writing-docs.md`. Keep the two in sync when rules change.

The docs are an NgMd site (AnalogJS + Angular + Tailwind + marked). Pages are markdown files in `apps/docs/src/content`. The file path is the URL. The sidebar is `nav` in `apps/docs/src/ngmd.config.ts`.

## 1. Audience and voice

- Readers are Angular developers who have built at least one app. Don't explain TypeScript, the CLI, components, signals or DI basics. Do explain Devframe, MCP and how this project works.
- Orient each page around what the reader wants to do.
- Second person and imperative. Present tense. Active voice.
- One idea per sentence. Short, plain sentences.
- Condition first: "If X, do Y."
- Sentence case headings.
- UI labels in **bold**. Code, files, commands and options in `code`.
- Descriptive link text, never "here".

## 2. Hard rules

Reviewers reject changes that break these.

1. **No em dashes.** Use a period, comma or parentheses.
2. **No first person** ("we", "our").
3. **No future tense** ("will").
4. **No time-relative claims** ("new", "recently", "upcoming", "now supports"). Use a sidebar `status` badge in `ngmd.config.ts` and the changelog instead.
5. **No comparisons with other devtools products.** Describe this project on its own terms.
6. **No marketing words**: powerful, seamless, blazingly fast, simply, just, easy.
7. **No invented features.** Every name, label, option, default, tool and argument must exist in the code.
8. **Lists with more than one attribute per item are tables.**
9. **One subject per page.** Link to angular.dev or MDN for background.

## 3. Page types

| Section         | Job                                         | Shape                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| getting-started | Get one setup running.                      | Intro, workflow of steps, code per setup, gotchas as callouts.                 |
| inspectors      | Explain one tab completely.                 | What it shows, where data comes from, how to use it, agent tools, limits, FAQ. |
| agents          | Reference for MCP server, tools, resources. | Tables of names, arguments, results, grouped by inspector.                     |
| guides          | One task end to end.                        | Workflow of steps with full working code.                                      |
| contributing    | Working on the repo.                        | Commands, tables, checklists.                                                  |

Don't mix explainer and tutorial content on one page.

## 4. Page skeleton

```md
---
title: Router
description: One sentence that summarizes the page.
---

<ngmd-hero title="Router" gradient>
  One or two sentences on what the page covers.
</ngmd-hero>

# Router

Short intro.

## Section

### Subsection

## Where to next

<ngmd-pill-row>
  <ngmd-pill href="/agents/tools" title="Agent tools"></ngmd-pill>
</ngmd-pill-row>
```

- One `#` heading, matching `title`. `##` sections with `###` subsections so the TOC has depth. Don't skip levels.
- Headings are unique within a page.
- Before renaming a heading, grep `apps/docs/src/content` for its anchor. Anchors are the slug of the heading text (lowercase, non-alphanumerics to `-`), badges excluded.
- Add new pages to `nav` in `ngmd.config.ts`.
- Link to other pages by the relative path of the `.md` file, in markdown links and `<a>` tags: `[Configuration](./configuration.md)`, `<a href="../inspectors/router.md#agent-tools">`. The site resolves them to routes and they also work on GitHub. Never write `/getting-started/...` routes in markdown links or `<a>`.
- `<ngmd-pill href>`, `<ngmd-card link>` and pages without a `.md` file (`/sponsors`) use the site route.
- `<ngmd-hero logo="...">` only on pages about one external tool (NgRx, Analog, Vite, Express, Chrome, MCP, Nx).

## 5. Components

Raw HTML in markdown. Always write explicit closing tags; never self-close custom elements.

| Component                                | Use for                                  | Attributes                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ngmd-hero`                              | Page opener, once, before `#`.           | `title`, `gradient`, `logo`                                            |
| `ngmd-callout`                           | Short aside.                             | `type`: info, tip, success, warning, danger. `title`                   |
| `ngmd-alert`                             | One point the reader must not miss.      | `severity`: info, helpful, important, warning, critical. `label`       |
| `ngmd-card-grid` > `ngmd-card`           | Related pages, requirements, overviews.  | grid `columns`. card `title`, `link`, `cta`, `icon`, `image`, `avatar` |
| `ngmd-workflow` > `ngmd-step`            | Ordered steps.                           | step `title`                                                           |
| `ngmd-accordion` > `ngmd-accordion-item` | FAQ.                                     | item `title`, `open`                                                   |
| `ngmd-pill-row` > `ngmd-pill`            | Related links at the end of a page.      | pill `href`, `title`                                                   |
| `ngmd-badge`                             | Status chip next to a heading.           | `variant`: new, updated, alpha, beta, stable, deprecated               |
| `ngmd-tabs` > `ngmd-tab`                 | Alternatives a code group can't express. | tab `title`, `icon`, `image`                                           |
| `ngmd-image`, `ngmd-video`               | Screenshots, YouTube or Vimeo.           | image `src`, `alt`, `caption`, `width`. video `src`, `title`           |

Card icons: book, box, code, compass, file, layers, lightbulb, palette, rocket, search, settings, shield, sparkles, terminal, wrench, zap.

Rules:

- Callouts and alerts are rare. Never adjacent, never inside a card, table cell or other component.
- Only nest the parent > child pairs above.
- If the page doesn't make sense without it, it's not a callout.
- End with a pill row or a card grid, not both.
- Inside components use HTML (`<code>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`); markdown doesn't render there. Write `@` as `&#64;`.
- Raw HTML external links need `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` or the build fails. Markdown links get it automatically.
- `*Angular`, `*Analog`, `*Devframe`, `*NgRx`, `*MCP`, `*Vite` are keyword links (`keywords` in `ngmd.config.ts`). The asterisk is intentional. Never "fix" it.

## 6. Code samples

- Always set the language. Put the file path in a comment on the first line: `// src/app/app.config.ts`.
- Highlight lines with `{3}` or `{2,5-7}` after the language. Count the path comment as line 1.
- Install commands use a code group: ` ```bash group="install" name="pnpm" active ` then npm, yarn, bun.
- `file="path#L5-L20"` imports a real file (relative to `apps/docs`, nothing outside it). It is not a title.
- Samples must run: every import, real export names from `packages/ng-devtools/package.json`, real option names and defaults.
- Source samples from the demos: `src/` (Angular Travel) and `examples/analog`.
- Load the overlay only in dev, with the `ngDevMode` dynamic import used on the installation page.
- Secure by default: no `auth: false` or `allowedOrigins: false` in copyable code unless the page explains it.
- UI code in samples follows accessibility basics: labels on controls, alt text on images.
- Realistic names (`TripSearch`, `authGuard`), no `Foo` or `prop1`. Comments explain why, and most samples need none.

## 7. Check claims against the code

| Page               | Source of truth                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| inspectors/\*      | `app/src/pages/*.ts` (the tab) and `packages/ng-devtools/src/*` (collectors, actions)                          |
| agents/\*          | `packages/ng-devtools/src/devframe.ts`, `rpc/*.ts`, `rpc/analog-register.ts`, Devframe built-ins               |
| getting-started/\* | `packages/ng-devtools/package.json` exports, `hub.ts`, `vite.ts`, `config.ts`, `overlay.ts`, `popup.ts`, demos |
| security           | `hub.ts`, `vite.ts`, `forms-privacy.ts`, `forms-actions.ts`, router and Analog redaction                       |
| contributing/\*    | root `package.json`, `nx.json`, `project.json` files, `.github/workflows`, `extension/`                        |

Check names exactly. When code changes, update the docs in the same PR. When unsure, say less rather than guess.

## 8. Verify

From the repo root:

1. `pnpm docs:dev` and open every changed page (TOC, links, dark mode).
2. `pnpm docs:build` (link and anchor guards).
3. `pnpm format:check` from the repo root. It checks content markdown too, so run `pnpm exec prettier --write` on the pages you changed.
4. Grep changed files for `—`, "will ", "we ", "new ", "recently", "simply", "just ".
